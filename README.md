# TVd

Letterboxd is a social network used by cinephiles to log movies and minisseries to their account. Users can make a diary of watches and review the movies they watch, as well as making lists and sharing what are their favorite movies.

The only problem with the app is that it doesn't cover TV shows. Thinking about this, I'm trying to build an web application that support the log and review of TV shows, using the The Movie Database (TMDb).
